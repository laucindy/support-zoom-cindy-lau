In this workshop you'll continue writing unit tests in Ruby using MiniTest.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo to your MacBook.

2. Take a look at the code in `lego.rb`.

3. Create a PR and in it describe:
    * each class
    * the purpose of each method in the class

4. Next, identify the following:
    * The expected behaviours (i.e. what does the method expect as input?).
    * The limits of the cases of expected behaviour (i.e. how many arguments can the method take?) .
    * Any exceptional/error cases.

5. Create a new file called `lego_test.rb`.

6. In it, create tests for each of the above cases that you've identified. Remember to make commits along the way!

7. Push `lego_test.rb` to GitHub.

8. Submit the link to your PR in Canvas.
